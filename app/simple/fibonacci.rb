#
#  In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci series 
#  or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following 
#  integer sequence:
#  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...; 
#  By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci 
#  sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the 
#  sum of the previous two.
#
#  Implement a static method int calc(int n), that returns
#  the nth Fibonacci number.
#  i.e Fibonacci.calc(0) -> 0
#    Fibonacci.calc(1) -> 1
#    Fibonacci.calc(2) -> 1
#    ... 
#
